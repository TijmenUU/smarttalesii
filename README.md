**This project is currently in the prototyping stage.**

## Dependencies
Currently the project requires the following:
- Microsoft's Visual Studio 2017 (VS2017) with Visual C++
- Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) version 2.4.2
Should work on Linux too, no platform specific libraries or APIs used.

## Branches
- master: the most recent stable build of the game. It may miss some upcoming features, but it should compile no problem.
- GameplayEvaluation: the first basic prototype of the game, for testing the fundamental game mechanics.
- shop: the build where the score screen and shop was added to the game, may be deleted in the future. May or may not build, as it is currently under development.

## About
This is a bachelors project for the University of Utrecht, 2017-2018. In short the project is about generating awareness of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), with a focus on the elderly. The game attempts to do this through providing a small but fun experience in the form of a small game.

The project is supervised by Fabiano Dalpiaz (@fabianodalp) and executed by Tijmen van Nesselrooij (@TijmenUU).
