# <-- This indicates a comment line, it is ignored by the game
# This file defines the game's difficulty settings

# The following per line layout is used:
# start_velocity increment_interval increment_velocity increment_max_velocity

# start_velocity
# Velocity of the scroll speed at the start

# increment_interval
# How many seconds (whole number) must pass before the increment_velocity 
# is added to the game's current velocity (making it scroll faster)

# increment_velocity
# The amount of velocity added per increment_interval timespan

# increment_max_velocity
# The upperbound of the velocity value, if the velocity is greater
# than this value after adding an increment, it is set to this value
# instead. This gives the game an upper boundry for the scrolling speed
