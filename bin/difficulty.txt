# <-- This indicates a comment line, it is ignored by the game
# This file defines the game's difficulty settings
# The game uses a 1280x720 fixed internal resolution, independent
# of the actual window size

# The following per line layout is used:
# start_velocity increment_velocity increment_max_velocity hint_border

# start_velocity
# Unit: pixels per second
# Velocity of the scroll speed at the start

# increment_velocity
# Unit: pixels per second
# The amount of velocity added per increment_interval timespan

# increment_max_velocity
# Unit: pixels per second
# The upperbound of the velocity value, if the velocity is greater
# than this value after adding an increment, it is set to this value
# instead. This gives the game an upper boundry for the scrolling speed

# hint_border
# Unit: pixels
# The border after which scrolling hints are being displayed above
# obstacles. Can be set to 0 to effectively turn it off.
